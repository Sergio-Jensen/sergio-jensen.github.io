abstract: >-
  The construction of the Global Value Chain (GVC) has greatly benefited the world economy. However, the recent surge in geopolitical conflicts has raised concerns about the potential fragmentation of GVCs, making it crucial for countries to identify effective means of mitigating the adverse political and economic consequences. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework to examine how geopolitical shock risk affects participation in GVCs and to explore which factors may serve as potential moderators, and then, regressions based on a panel dataset of 77 countries covering 1995–2020 are conducted to seek empirical support. The baseline regressions, along with a series of robustness checks and endogeneity settlements, demonstrate that geopolitical shock risk indeed hinders GVC participation, whereas domestic financing convenience exerts a highly significant mitigating effect. Moreover, heterogeneity analyses based on marginal effects suggest that countries participating in different segments of the GVC interact with geopolitical conflicts in heterogeneous ways; in contrast, inter-sectoral level analyses highlight the strong consistency of the negative effects of geopolitical shock risk and the robust effectiveness of domestic financing convenience in alleviating such impacts.
