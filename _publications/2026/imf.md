abstract: >-
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditionality has received extensive attention in the study of international organizations and international political economy. The existing literature provides explanations for variations in IMF conditionality from the perspectives of economic importance, power politics, ideas, bureaucracy, and bargaining power. Based on the existing studies, this paper proposes that the intensity of outside options possessed by the borrowing country affects its bargaining power vis-à-vis the IMF, i.e., the stronger the financing capacity of the Regional Financial Arrangements (RFAs) in which the borrowing country participates, the more lenient the conditions of the IMF loan it receives. At the same time, while the vertex centrality of the borrowing country can be leveraged by the IMF’s concern about “too big to fail” to obtain concessions on lending conditions, the risk of potential financial crises spreading within the region undermines the bargaining power that RFAs can provide. To examine how the intensity of outside options and the degree of vertex centrality of the borrowing countries jointly affect their bargaining power vis-à-vis the IMF, this paper empirically examines the data of the sample of borrowing countries that have obtained IMF loans from 1995 to 2019. Through analyzing the bargaining process between Latin American Reserve Fund member countries and the IMF, it demonstrates the qualitative evidence empirical of the above theoretical framework.
