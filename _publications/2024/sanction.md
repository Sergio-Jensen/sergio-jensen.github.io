abstract: >-
  This study examines how the United States leverages multilateral institutions to enhance the effectiveness of financial sanctions in counter-terrorist financing governance. Through an analysis of the dual-pressure mechanism involving U.S. Treasury sanctions and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) blacklisting, we demonstrate how institutional nesting processes enable major powers to legitimize coercive measures and amplify their policy impact. Using a mixed-methods approach combining panel data analysis of 173 countries (2001-2023) with comparative case studies of Pakistan and the Philippines, we find that the interaction between U.S. sanctions and FATF pressure produces significantly stronger compliance effects than either mechanism alone. The study provides new insights into how multilateral institutions can serve as vehicles for hegemonic power projection in global governance.
