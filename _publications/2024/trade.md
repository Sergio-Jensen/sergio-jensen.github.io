abstract: >-
  Indicators of “competitiveness” are widely used to study the trade competition; however, such indicators tend to ignore the economic heterogeneity of commodities and the correlation between research individuals. Based on the bipartite network, this article combines the asymmetric reflection algorithm and the Matrix-Estimation Exercise to re-measure the competition of countries and products in export trade. According to the results, the competition of countries and products are both depend on countries’ export structure and products’ trade structure, neither is directly correlated to the respective volume of export trade. The competition of products and countries is interconnected, and changes of either sides will affect the other, with this effect rippling through the network. Furthermore, the results show that the method for calculation adopted in this article can retain most of information in the international trade network, and the calculation results remain consistent under different situations, no subversive conclusions have been reached.
