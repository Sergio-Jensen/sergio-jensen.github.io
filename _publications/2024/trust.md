 As integral pillars of global governance, International Organizations (IOs) merit systematic scrutiny regarding their roles in the ascent of populism and the mechanisms through which the adverse political repercussions that populism imposes on the international system — can be offset. This article contends that, despite the pivotal position of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in global governance, the “incompatibility” between its lending conditionalities and policy requirements of recipient states, together with the “unaffordability” of the reforms it imposes, often catalyze populist takeovers. Conversely, societal trust dampens such a triggering effect of IMF conditionalities on populist incumbency within recipient states. Drawing on 5,671 primary IMF documents incorporated with LLM-based contextual analyses, this article constructs an original dataset that operationalizes the incompatibility and unaffordability of IMF conditionalities. Using a sampleconsists of countries that exists debt-creditor relationship with the IMF between 1980 and 2019, baseline regressions and a series of robustness checks demonstrate that IMF conditionalities indeed systematically spur (predominantly left-wing) populist takeovers in recipient states; at the same time, the article artificially codes the rotation schedule of elected directors with their alternatives of the IMF Executive Board from the IMF Annual Reports and employs it as the instrumental variable; the results after addressing potential endogeneity remain robust. Furthermore, based on 667 thousand respondents integrated from the World Values Survey (WVS) and European Values Survey (EVS), and modeled via the GPC-MP (Monotonic Polynomial Generalized Partial Credit) model, this article constructs the third original dataset, which captures national levels of social trust; subsequent moderation analyses confirm that higher social trust significantly mitigates the impact of IMF conditionalities on populist incumbency
