abstract: >-
  Green innovation plays a crucial role in the context of the low-carbon economy, but it is equally important to focus on gatekeeping the quality of innovation amidst the plethora of innovative outcomes. Polluting firms typically represent the lower bound of the pollution governance level within an economic entity. Therefore, the impact of environmental regulations on the “quantity” and “quality” aspects of green innovation in polluting firms is worth considering. This article empirically examines the effects of China’s carbon emission trading pilot on green innovation in polluting firms listed in the A-share, based on patent grants and applications with their citation information. The results show that the carbon emission trading pilot indeed stimulates green innovation at the “quantity” level through the “leverage effect”, and such incentive is moderated by social responsibility assumed by firms. However, the “quality” of green innovation and even that of the overall technological level are significantly inhibited by the carbon emission trading pilot. The results imply that there exists a certain “innovation illusion” in the green innovation of polluting firms listed in the A-share. It is necessary to implement effective incentive policies to ensure both the “quantity” and “quality” are improved synchronically.
