abstract: >-
  In the era of competing for core competence, the increasing inputs of knowledge factors have brought the issue of “efficiency-enhancing and quality-improving” into focus; and concerns about the “quality” perspective of knowledge require mining information related to complex knowledge hidden in the economic system. In order to quantify knowledge complexity at both the national (or regional) and technological levels, this article combines the Fitness and Complexity algorithm with matrix-estimation exercises based on the framework of the bipartite network. On the basis of these measurements, this article analyzes and discusses the economic implications and evolutionary features while considering the “expiration” of patents; additionally, community detection is conducted to discuss the evolution of the “location” of complex knowledge. The results show that knowledge complexity depends on the structural similarity and specialization of patents; furthermore, the timeliness of patents may affect knowledge complexity conspicuously; moreover, the significance of the “location” of complex knowledge in the past has been downplayed over the past few decades.
